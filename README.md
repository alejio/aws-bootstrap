# aws-bootstrap

Coding along with [The Good Parts of AWS](https://gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts).

Learning how to deploy from scratch a production-ready application with AWS Cloudformation; in this case a basic `hello-world` Javascript app. Which as a consequence has not made me love `npm` :)

Also, at the time of writing the authors have not yet released their code on Github, and as one would expect the code in the book has a few errata. Debugging is a great way to truly learn stuff!
